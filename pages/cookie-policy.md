### What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

_Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
 technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").
 These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone
has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to
 monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or
 communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online
 advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the
success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies
 to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

### Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?

_Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to,
 among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and
 for other site operations.
If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash
 player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel .
 You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the
instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash
 Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block
Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).

 impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in
