Shortly after the launch of the POCO X2 earlier this year, we learned that a new POCO phone was in the works. However, we knew it to be a flagship device called the POCO F2 Pro which would essentially be a rebranded version of the Redmi K30 Pro. But we now have evidence to believe that the POCO F2 Pro isn’t the only device that the company is working on right now and it may soon launch another mid-range device.

A new device, called the POCO M2 Pro, was recently spotted on the Mi India website, in the section where Xiaomi lists data from its SAR testing. The device has the model name “M2003J6CI” and,  according to an analysis conducted by XDA tipsters kacskrz and akhilnarang, the device has the code-name “gram.” Kacskrz has also spotted firmware for “gram_in_global”, which suggests that the phone will launch in India.  Interestingly, the code-name “gram” has previously appeared in the kernel source code for the Redmi Note 9 Pro and a watermark for “gram” has also appeared in the firmware for the Redmi Note 9 Pro.

Since the Note 9 Pro is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G, we suspect that the upcoming POCO M2 Pro may also feature the same SoC. However, we can’t be sure of this, since it’s possible that the device is running on a Qualcomm processor that’s software compatible with the Snapdragon 720G, which would also explain why references to “gram” appear in the Redmi Note 9 Pro’s kernel source code and firmware. What we can safely assume, however, is that this POCO M2 Pro may be a mid-range smartphone powered by a Snapdragon 7 series processor.

It’s also worth mentioning that Xiaomi has since removed all mention of the POCO M2 Pro from the website, but you can still see the listing in an archived version of the page.

These certification listings confirm the existence of the POCO M2 Pro along with its model number, affirming the previous information we reported on the device. Unfortunately, there’s not a whole lot to learn about the device beyond this information. We’ll keep you posted when we find out more.
